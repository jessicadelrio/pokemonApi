Search for Pokemon!!!

This uses the Pokemon API. You have to use Chrome to get a result back. 

If you search for a Pokemon's name or number, you get to see a picture of the Pokemon, the name of the Pokemon, its type, and its ability. 

I give credit to Dennis Tat's Pokemon Guide with jqueryMobile and PhoneGap/Cordora. It helped me learn how to receive data from the JSON response and how to display it.  http://pokeapi-how.appspot.com
